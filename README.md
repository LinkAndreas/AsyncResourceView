# AsyncResourceView

## Motivation

Modern apps heavily rely on resources that are received over the network, and hence may be affected by connectivity issues or data loss. If, for example, you travel by train within Germany, you may be surprised how often you will experience radio gaps or interruptions due to weak cellular reception. Hence, we as developers have to design our apps to include feedback when an action takes longer than expected and offer the ability to retry the action in case that it failed. This way, we can make our apps stand out, since they can cope with conditions that are far from optimal.

`AsyncResourceView` offers a consistent way to deal with loading as well as error states in SwiftUI applications. This way, developers can focus on features rather than writing repetitive error-prone code.

## Installation

Installation via [SwiftPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is supported.
